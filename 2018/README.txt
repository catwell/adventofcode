# Advent of Code 2018

This year I am doing Advent of Code in both Lua and Haskell, at least for the first few days.

Note that I don't know much Haskell, so my solutions are probably terrible. My goal is not to have clean solutions this year, just to have something that works and learn a bit more Haskell.
